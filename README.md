# Creed

**One file across every agent.**

Your personal context, written once and kept polished by your agents — so every AI you talk to knows you instantly.

## What is Creed?

Anyone using AI seriously hits the same tax: re-explaining themselves every chat, every tool, every session.

Creed kills that tax with one file.

You write yourself down once — your role, goals, preferences, routines, the people who matter, anything you want every AI to know — and connected agents read that file before they answer you. As they learn new things about you, they propose updates. You approve the good ones. The file sharpens over time.

It's not a notes app. It's not a journal. It's not a memory dump. It's a curated personal-context profile, sized to fit on one page, that travels with you across Claude, ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes, OpenCode, and any custom agent you wire up.

---

## Why Creed exists

There's a small set of tools every AI-native person re-invents for themselves: a "system prompt" that grows in their notes, a `CLAUDE.md` they paste into every project, a list of "things ChatGPT keeps getting wrong about me." Creed is what happens when you decide that file should be **a real product**, not a hack.

The file is plain Markdown. The app exists to:

- help you write the first draft (4-vibe onboarding tuned to who you are)
- score quality and surface gaps (a monthly AI allowance, or bring your own OpenRouter key)
- let agents read and propose updates without you copy-pasting
- keep one canonical version across every tool you use

If you've ever maintained a personal `creed.md` by hand, this is that, with the boring parts solved.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────────────┐         ┌────────────────────┐
│  You — onboarding    │ ──────► │  Your Creed file   │
│  (one short pass)    │         │  10 sections, MD   │
└──────────────────────┘         └─────────┬──────────┘
                                           │
                              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                              ▼                         ▼
                  ┌─────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
                  │  Agent reads it     │    │  Agent proposes an   │
                  │  before answering   │    │  update; you approve │
                  └─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘
```

The file has 10 sections — five core, five optional — sized so the whole thing reads in under a minute:

| Always-on   | Optional      |
|-------------|---------------|
| Identity    | Beliefs       |
| Goals       | Constraints   |
| Work        | People        |
| Preferences | Health        |
| Routines    | Context       |

Every section is agent-writable. Every change goes through the review (or direct-edit, if you trust it).

## Status

Creed is in active development. Personal Creed is the core one-user product. Creed Company extends the same file model into a shared workspace with roles, per-section permissions, attribution, invitations, pooled AI credits, and seat billing.

Paid hosted plans include a monthly AI allowance for first-party features like quality analysis, billed as prepaid credits, with an optional bring-your-own-OpenRouter-key mode. Self-hosted development can run the app locally with your own Supabase, Stripe, and OpenRouter configuration.

---

## Run it locally

You'll need:

- **Node.js 20+**
- **a Supabase project** (free tier is fine)
- **an OpenRouter API key** (only needed for the AI-powered features — onboarding synthesis, quality analysis, refinement)
- **a Stripe account** (only needed for hosted-style paid plans, Company seats, and webhooks)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/creed.git
cd creed
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the template and fill in values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

`.env.example` documents every variable Creed reads. The minimum to boot the app:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-supabase-publishable-key>
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=<your-supabase-service-role-key>
CREED_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=<base64-encoded-32-byte-secret>
```

Generate the encryption secret with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

Optional (branding shown in the public chrome, payments, GitHub integration, feedback widget) are all documented inline in `.env.example` — copy whichever ones you want to enable.

### 3. Run database migrations

```bash
# install Supabase CLI if you don't have it: brew install supabase/tap/supabase
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push
```

This creates every table Creed needs (sections, proposals, activity, tokens, MCP, GitHub, AI usage, audit log, rate limits, Stripe entitlements) plus the row-level-security policies that make sure users only ever see their own data.

### 4. (Optional) Wire up Stripe

The hosted Creed gates `/file` and `/onboarding` behind a paid entitlement (Personal is $12/mo, $99/yr, or $199 lifetime). For local development you can either:

- **Skip it** — leave `STRIPE_*` env vars unset. The app still boots; signed-in users without an entitlement row are redirected to `/pricing` by the layout guard. Useful when you only want to work on marketing pages or non-paid flows.
- **Run the full flow** — add the four `STRIPE_*` variables from `.env.example` using your sandbox/test keys, then in a second terminal run:
  ```bash
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
  ```
  Copy the `whsec_…` it prints into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. The webhook auto-grants entitlements when test payments complete.

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Sign in with Google and you'll land on `/pricing` (or `/onboarding` if you've granted yourself an entitlement row manually for development).

### Deploying your own

If you're standing up a separate hosted Creed (not contributing back to this repo):

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your deployed origin so OAuth callback and Stripe redirect URLs resolve correctly.
- Set `CREED_CSP_ENFORCE=1` in production once you've watched one deploy cycle in Report-Only mode.
- The Stripe webhook signing secret in production differs from your local `whsec_…` — create a webhook endpoint in the live Stripe dashboard pointing at `https://<your-domain>/api/stripe/webhook` and use that secret.
- The dormant example agent prompts in `lib/creed-data.ts` reference `https://creed.md` purely as illustration; real users see URLs derived from your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` at request time.

---

## Connect an agent

Once you have a Creed, open `/connections` and add the Creed MCP URL to your agent as a custom connector. The client opens a browser, you click **Allow** on the Creed consent screen, and it's connected. No tokens to copy. We have first-class flows for:

- Claude Code (a one-line `claude mcp add` command)
- Codex
- OpenClaw
- Hermes
- OpenCode
- Cursor (one-click "Add to Cursor")
- Custom Agent (any client that speaks MCP)

MCP uses OAuth 2.1: Creed is its own authorization server (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`, `/.well-known/*`), so any spec-compliant client connects from the server URL alone. The agent verifies it can read your file and starts shaping replies around it from the next message forward. For clients that don't speak MCP, the `/api/creed` HTTP API is the documented fallback.

## Contributing

We'd love contributions. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR — it's short and saves both of us time.

If you're an AI agent picking up this codebase to make changes, read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first instead. It's the same information, written for you.
