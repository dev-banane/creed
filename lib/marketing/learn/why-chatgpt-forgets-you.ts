    "ChatGPT does remember some things. It has saved memories you can add to, and it can reference your past chats to sound more familiar over time. So it is not accurate to say ChatGPT has no memory. What is true is narrower and more frustrating: that memory lives only inside ChatGPT, it is opaque about what it actually kept, and it does not travel to Claude, Cursor, or any other tool you use.\n\nThat is why it can still feel like ChatGPT forgets you. A model that knows you in one app is a stranger in the next one, and even inside ChatGPT you cannot see the profile it is working from or move it anywhere. You end up re-explaining the same facts across tools, and trusting a store you cannot read.\n\nThe durable fix is to stop keeping your context inside any one chatbot. Write who you are once into a portable context file, and have every AI read that file before it answers. Creed is one such file: a profile you own that your agents read over MCP, so the same context follows you across every tool instead of being trapped in one app's memory.",

The first is saved memories: short facts ChatGPT records when you tell it something worth keeping, which you can view and delete in settings.
