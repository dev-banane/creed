    "A team context file is one shared profile that describes how your company works, which every member's AI reads before it answers. Instead of each teammate re-explaining the same company context to their own assistant, and each assistant guessing differently, the whole team points its agents at one page: how you ship, what you name things, who owns what, the constraints that never change.\n\nIt is short and curated, not a document dump. The point is not to store everything the company knows; it is to keep the handful of durable facts that change how an AI should respond for anyone on the team. Because every agent reads the same file, answers stop drifting from how the team actually operates. Creedom's Company plan is a team context file: one shared Company Creedom every member's agents read, with roles for who can edit what, an activity view of every change, and admin controls, all built on the same plain Markdown a personal Creedom uses.",

One person tells Claude how deploys work, another tells ChatGPT the same thing in different words, a third never mentions it and gets a generic answer.

      text: "The result is drift. Agents give advice that does not match how the team actually works, because no agent has ever read how the team actually works. New hires hit it hardest: their assistants know nothing about the codebase, the conventions, or the people, so the human has to fill every gap by hand. A team context file fixes the root cause by giving every agent one page to read first.",
