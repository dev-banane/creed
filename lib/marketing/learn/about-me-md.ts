    "about-me.md is a short Markdown introduction to yourself that you paste into an AI tool so it stops treating you like a stranger. Instead of re-explaining your job, your goals, and how you like answers at the start of every chat, you keep a few lines in one file and drop them into each tool's custom instructions or memory. It is the simplest form of a personal context file, and it takes five minutes to write.\n\nA good about-me.md is short and specific: who you are, what you are working on, how you want to be answered, and any hard limits. If a line would not change how an assistant responds, it does not belong.\n\nThe convention has three real limits. It is static, so it goes stale unless you edit it. It is manual, so you paste it into each tool by hand. And it is per-tool, so every app keeps its own copy and they drift apart. Creedom automates all three: it is one personal context file that every AI you connect reads before it answers, kept current by agent proposals you approve.",
