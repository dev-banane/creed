    "ChatGPT and Claude do not share memory. Each keeps its own private store, and neither can read the other's. So the context you built up in ChatGPT means nothing to Claude, and you end up maintaining two half-versions of yourself, one in each app.\n\nYou can copy and paste a profile into both, and that works for a day. But the two copies drift apart the moment your work changes, and you are back to manual upkeep in two places. The manual approach does not scale past a tool or two.\n\nThe durable fix is to keep your context in one file that both tools read, rather than inside either app. Put the file in one place you own, connect it to ChatGPT and to Claude, and each reads the same profile before it answers. Creedom is one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers; both ChatGPT and Claude connect to it over MCP, so a single profile stays consistent across both instead of living in two disconnected memories.",

      answer:

      question: "Will the shared context stay up to date?",
      answer:
        "Yes, if you maintain it. Connected agents propose small updates as they learn something durable, and you approve what stays. Because both tools read the same file, one update reaches both.",
