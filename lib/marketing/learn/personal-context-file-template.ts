    "A personal context file is one structured Markdown profile that every AI you connect reads before it answers. This is a full template you can copy today. It has ten sections: five always-on core sections that everyone fills in, Identity, Goals, Work, Preferences, and Routines, plus five optional ones, Beliefs, Constraints, People, Health, and Context, that you add only when they earn their place.\n\nCopy the template below, delete the placeholder lines, and replace them with facts that actually change how an AI should respond to you. The guiding rule is specific over complete: a short profile that changes answers beats a long one that reads like a resume. If a line would not change what an assistant says, leave it out.\n\nYou can keep this file anywhere and paste it into each tool by hand. Creed keeps the same ten-section profile live, connects it to your agents over MCP, and lets them propose narrow updates you approve, so the file follows you across every tool and stays current without manual copying.",

I write in English.\n\n# Goals\n- Ship the studio's new portfolio site by end of Q3.\n- Land two retainer clients this year, not one-off projects.\n- Learn enough SQL to stop asking a contractor for every report.\n\n# Work\n- Brand and product design for early-stage startups.\n- Tools: Figma, Notion, Linear, a little HTML/CSS.\n- I bill by project, not by hour. I protect deep-work mornings.\n- Decisions I own: scope, pricing, hiring. My partner owns delivery.\n\n# Preferences\n- Answer first, then explain. Lead with the recommendation.\n- Be direct. Skip preamble and hedging.\n- Use British spelling. No em dashes.\n- For code, give me the whole file, not a diff.\n\n# Routines\n- Deep work 08:00-12:00; no meetings before noon.\n- Fridays are admin and invoicing.\n- I plan the week on Sunday evening.\n\n# Beliefs (optional)\n- I would rather ship something small and real than plan something big.\n\n# Constraints (optional)\n- No calls after 18:00. Do not suggest tools that need a US bank account.\n\n# People (optional)\n- Tom is my studio partner and handles all client delivery.\n- Priya is my accountant; route tax questions to her, not me.\n\n# Health (optional)\n- I manage migraines; keep long reading tasks broken into chunks.\n\n# Context (optional)\n- Currently rebranding the studio from \"Okonkwo Design\" to \"Field\".",
