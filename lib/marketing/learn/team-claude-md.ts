    "Engineers already know CLAUDE.md: a file at the root of a repository that tells Claude Code how that project works, its conventions, its commands, its gotchas. It is genuinely useful, and it is also narrow. It lives in one repo, guides one tool, and only helps the people working in that codebase. Nothing about your team travels with it.\n\nA CLAUDE.md for your whole team is the same idea made shared and portable: one context file every member's agents read before they answer, in every project and every tool, not just in one repository and not just for people who write code. It carries how the team ships, what it names things, who owns what, and the constraints that apply to everyone. Creedom's Company plan is that file: one shared Company Creedom with member roles, an activity view, and admin controls, built on plain Markdown the team owns. You keep the habit that a repo CLAUDE.md gave you, and you lift it out of a single repo so it works for the whole company.",
