    "To connect Creedom to Cursor, add it as a remote MCP server in Cursor's settings and authorize it once with OAuth. Point the server at https://creed.md/mcp, then complete authorization in the browser by clicking Allow on the Creedom consent screen while signed in to creed.md. There is no key to copy; the handshake is OAuth.\n\nOnce connected, Cursor can read your Creedom profile before it plans or edits, so it starts already knowing your role, stack, goals, and preferences rather than working cold. As it learns something durable about you, it can propose a narrow update you approve.\n\nCreed is one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers. In Cursor, that means the same profile your other agents use also shapes how Cursor reasons about your code. You verify the connection by confirming the tools are available and calling read_creed once.",
