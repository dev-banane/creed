    "If you used a life-logging tool like Rewind or Limitless to record and recall everything, you are probably looking for an alternative as those consumer recorders wind down or change hands. The useful shift is not finding another tool that records everything. It is moving from capturing your whole day to curating the small set of facts about you that actually change how AI responds.\n\nAlways-on recording promised total recall: capture every screen, meeting, and word, then search it later. In practice most of that data is noise, it raises real privacy questions, and it still lives inside one app. The value you wanted was rarely the raw archive. It was an assistant that knows you.\n\nThere are a few alternative approaches, from lighter recorders to note systems to owned context profiles. Creedom is the owned-context option: one structured Markdown profile you write and control, that every AI you connect reads before it answers. Instead of recording everything and searching later, you keep a short, current profile and every tool starts already knowing who you are.",

      text: "The premise of always-on life-logging was appealing: record your screen, your meetings, and your conversations, and never lose a detail. As those consumer recorders wind down or change hands, it is worth asking what they were really for. The goal was not a giant archive; it was recall, and increasingly, an AI that could answer using your history.",

      text: "Recording everything has costs that do not go away. Most captured data is never needed. Continuous capture of screens and audio carries privacy weight, for you and for the people around you.

A short, specific profile beats a vast archive for the thing most people actually wanted: assistants that already know their context.",
