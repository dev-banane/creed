    "There are two common ways to give an AI your context without retyping it. A browser-extension memory tool watches the chat you type into a web page and injects saved context into the prompt before you send it. An MCP-connected context file lets the agent itself read a structured file over a protocol, before it answers, in whatever tool you are using.\n\nThe difference is where the context enters. An extension works at the surface, in the browser, editing what goes into a web chat box. MCP works underneath, giving the agent a tool it can call to read your profile directly. That changes coverage, reliability, and portability in ways worth understanding before you pick one.\n\nExtensions are easy to start with and work in the chat UIs you already open in a browser. MCP context reaches beyond the browser into coding agents and terminal tools, and does not depend on a page layout staying the same. Creedom is an MCP-connected context file: one Markdown profile that every agent you connect reads before it answers, whether that agent runs in a browser or not.",

      text: "A browser extension sits in the page. When you type into a web chat like a hosted assistant, the extension detects the input box and prepends or injects your stored context so the model sees it. Everything happens at the browser surface: it is editing the text that gets submitted to a web UI you have open.",
    },
    {
      type: "p",
      text: "This is convenient because there is nothing to configure inside the agent. You install the extension, it recognizes the sites it supports, and it starts adding context. For someone who lives in one or two web chat interfaces, that can be enough.",

      text: "MCP is a protocol that lets an agent call tools. An MCP-connected context file exposes a read tool the agent invokes on its own, before meaningful work, to load your profile. The context does not depend on any page; the agent asks for it directly and factors it into the answer. Creedom works this way: you connect it once, and the agent reads the file over MCP.",

      question: "What is the difference between a memory browser extension and MCP context?",
      answer:

    },

      question: "Do browser extensions work in coding agents like Cursor?",
      answer:
        "Usually not, because coding agents are not web pages an extension can inject into. Those agents speak MCP, so an MCP-connected context file like Creedom reaches them while a browser extension typically cannot.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is MCP context more reliable than a browser extension?",
      answer:
        "It tends to be, because the agent calls a tool to read the file rather than depending on a specific page layout. Extensions can break when the sites they support change their interface.",

      question: "Can I use both at once?",
      answer:
        "Yes. An extension can cover a web chat site that lacks MCP support while MCP context covers coding agents and portability. Creedom is the MCP-connected option, giving you one owned profile every connected agent reads.",
