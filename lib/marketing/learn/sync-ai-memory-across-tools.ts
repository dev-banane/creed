    "AI memory does not sync across tools, because each tool keeps its own private store. ChatGPT's memory, Claude's context, and Cursor's settings are separate, and none of them can read the others. So there is no built-in switch that makes them consistent, and trying to keep three in-app memories aligned by hand is a losing game.\n\nThe way to actually sync is to stop relying on per-tool memory and keep one context file that every tool reads instead. Put your durable facts in a file you own, connect each tool to it, and every agent loads the same profile before it answers. Change the file once, and all of them see the update.\n\nCreed works this way. It is one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers, connected to your agents over MCP. Rather than syncing three memories, you give ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor a single source of truth, so they stay consistent because they are all reading the same page.",
