    "A personal context file is a single, structured profile that describes who you are and how you want AI to work with you, written once and read by every AI tool you connect. Instead of re-explaining your job, your goals, and your preferences at the start of every chat, you keep them in one file that ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and other agents read before they answer.\n\nIt is plain text you own, usually Markdown, organized into short sections like identity, goals, work, preferences, and constraints. A good one is specific and current, not a diary. The point is not to store everything about you; it is to keep the handful of facts that actually change how an AI should respond, in a form any tool can read. Creed is a personal context file that connects to your agents over MCP, so the same profile follows you across every tool, and your agents can propose updates as they learn more about you.",

      text: "Built-in memory helps a little, but it is trapped inside one app. ChatGPT's memory does not move to Claude. Claude's projects do not move to Cursor.
