    "To connect Creed to ChatGPT, add it as a custom remote MCP connector in ChatGPT's settings, then authorize it once with OAuth. Open Settings, go to Connectors, add a custom or remote MCP server using the URL https://creed.md/mcp, and authorize by clicking Allow on the Creed consent screen while signed in to creed.md. There is no key to paste; the whole handshake is OAuth.\n\nOnce connected, ChatGPT can read your Creed profile before it answers, so it starts already knowing your identity, goals, work, and preferences instead of asking you to re-explain them. As it learns something durable about you, it can propose a narrow update you approve.\n\nCreed is one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers. Connector availability in ChatGPT depends on your plan and the current rollout, so the exact menu wording may differ. The setup shape is the same: add the remote MCP server, authorize, and verify by calling read_creed once.",
