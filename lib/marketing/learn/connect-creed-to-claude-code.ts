    "To connect Creed to Claude Code, add it as an HTTP MCP server and authorize it once with OAuth. From a terminal, run the add command, then run the authorize step inside Claude Code and click Allow on the Creed consent screen while signed in to creed.md. There is no key to copy; the whole handshake is OAuth.\n\nOnce connected, Claude Code reads your Creed profile before meaningful work, so it starts already knowing your identity, goals, stack, and preferences. As it learns something durable about you, it proposes a narrow update you can approve, or writes directly if you have granted that. You verify the connection by listing the MCP tools and calling read_creed once.\n\nCreed is one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers. Wiring it into Claude Code means your coding agent stops working cold and starts from the same profile your other tools use.",
