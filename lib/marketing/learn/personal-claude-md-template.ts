    "CLAUDE.md is the file Claude Code reads before it works in a repository. This is a personal version of that file: instead of project conventions, it holds the durable facts about you an AI should never have to ask for. Copy the template below into a CLAUDE.md, replace the placeholders with real facts, and an agent that reads it will start already knowing who you are and how you want to be answered.\n\nKeep it short and specific. The value is in lines that change how an assistant responds, not in completeness. Four sections cover almost everyone: who you are, how you work, your preferences, and your constraints.\n\nA per-file approach works, but it lives in one repository and one tool, and nothing keeps it current except you. Creedom is the portable version: one personal context file that every AI you connect reads before it answers, kept sharp by agent proposals you approve. Use the template to start, and upgrade when you get tired of maintaining copies.",

Not mine: [delivery, legal].\n\n# Preferences\n- Answer first, then explain. Lead with the recommendation.\n- Be direct. No preamble, no hedging, no flattery.\n- For code: give me the whole file, not a diff. [language / framework] by default.\n- Style: no em dashes; [any other hard rules].\n\n# Constraints\n- Never [a hard limit, e.g. suggest tools that need a US bank account].\n- Do not [another, e.g. schedule anything before 10:00].\n- Assume [a default that keeps you from having to correct it, e.g. remote-first].",
