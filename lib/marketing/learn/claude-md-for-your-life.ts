    "CLAUDE.md is the file Claude Code reads before it does anything in a repository. It holds project instructions, conventions, and commands, so the agent starts every task already knowing how that codebase works instead of guessing. Developers love it because it turns repeated explanation into a file the tool reads for you.\n\nA CLAUDE.md for your life applies the same idea to you rather than a codebase. You write down who you are, how you work, your preferences, and your constraints once, and an agent reads it before it answers. It works, and it is a good habit. But a per-repo file has real limits: it lives in one repository, it does not travel to other tools, and nothing keeps it current except you.\n\nCreed is the portable version of that idea: one personal context file that every AI you connect reads before it answers, kept sharp by agent proposals you approve. This guide covers the pattern, its limits, and how to upgrade from a file in one repo to one profile every tool reads.",

It is where you put the things you would otherwise repeat: how to build and test the project, naming conventions, which directories matter, and any rules the agent should follow. The file lives in the repository, usually at the root, so it is versioned alongside the code and shared with everyone who clones it.",

        "Yes. You can write a personal CLAUDE.md with sections for who you are, how you work, your preferences, and your constraints. It works, but the file is per-repo and Claude Code specific, so other tools will not read it and nothing keeps it current on its own.",

      question: "Why does a per-repo file not work for personal context?",
      answer:
        "Your identity is not scoped to one repository or one tool. A CLAUDE.md lives in a single repo and is a Claude Code convention, so you end up copying it into every project and every app, and the copies drift apart. A portable context file every agent reads solves that.",
