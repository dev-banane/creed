    "You retype the same context in every new chat and every new tool. Here is the re-explaining tax, why the usual fixes do not stick, and the one file that ends it.",

    "If you use AI often, you pay a re-explaining tax. Every new chat starts cold, so you retype your role, your project, your tone, and the constraints you have already stated a dozen times. Then you open a second tool and do it all again, because what you told ChatGPT never reaches Claude or Cursor. The cost per message is small. Over a year, across tools, it is enormous.\n\nMost people try to patch it. They fill in custom instructions, paste a blurb at the top of important chats, or lean on built-in memory. Each helps a little, and none of it sticks. Instructions are capped and app-bound. Pasted blurbs are manual and go stale. Memory is opaque and trapped inside one vendor. So the tax keeps getting charged.\n\nThe fix is to write yourself down once and have every tool read the same page. Keep one structured context file that describes who you are and how you want AI to work, and connect it to the agents you use so it is read before every answer. Creedom is that file: one personal context file that every AI reads before it answers, so you explain yourself once instead of forever.",

      question: "Why do I have to keep re-explaining myself to AI?",

        "Because context lives inside each app. New chats start cold, and what one tool learns never reaches another. Until your context lives in one file every tool reads, you keep restating the same facts.",
