    "ChatGPT custom instructions are two text boxes in your settings: one for what ChatGPT should know about you, and one for how you want it to respond. They apply to your account inside ChatGPT and quietly prefix your chats, so you do not repeat your role, tone, and preferences every time. They are useful and worth filling in.\n\nThe catch is that they are short. Each box is limited, so they are best for a tight summary, not your whole context. They also live only inside ChatGPT: they do not shape Claude, Cursor, or any other tool, and there is no clean way to move them. Once you have written a crisp version, you tend to hit the ceiling and start trimming.\n\nWhen the boxes run out, you have options. You can tighten what you keep, lean on a Project for scoped context, paste a longer profile at the start of a chat, use ChatGPT memory for durable facts, or move your context into a portable file every tool reads. Creed takes that last approach: one context file you own that your agents read over MCP, so the same profile follows you across tools instead of living in two capped boxes.",

      question: "How long can ChatGPT custom instructions be?",
      answer:
        "Both boxes are limited, so they hold a short summary rather than your entire context. Rather than counting characters, treat them as space for the few lines that change how ChatGPT responds, and keep anything longer somewhere else.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do custom instructions work in Claude or Cursor?",
      answer:
        "No. Custom instructions apply inside ChatGPT only. Other tools never see them, which is why relying on them alone leaves you re-explaining yourself in every other app.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between custom instructions and memory?",
      answer:
        "Custom instructions are text you write and control directly. Memory is what ChatGPT saves or infers over time. Both are ChatGPT-only, so neither carries over to other tools.",

      question: "How do I keep more context without hitting the limit?",
      answer:
        "Tighten the boxes to essentials and move the rest into a portable context file that every tool reads. That way custom instructions stay short and your full profile lives in one place you own, available across ChatGPT, Claude, and more.",
