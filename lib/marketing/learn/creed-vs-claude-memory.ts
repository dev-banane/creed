    "Claude Projects, project knowledge, and Claude's memory are built to scope context to a workspace inside Claude, and they are good at it. A Project gathers the files, instructions, and knowledge for one body of work, so every chat in that Project starts with the right background loaded. If your goal is to give Claude deep, durable context about one initiative, this is a strong tool and the natural choice.\n\nA portable context file solves a different problem: it is one profile about you that every AI you connect reads, not just Claude. It is plain text you own, organized into short sections, and it travels across ChatGPT, Cursor, and other agents alongside Claude. Where a Project is scoped to a workspace and lives inside Claude, a context file is scoped to you and lives outside any single app.\n\nThe two are complementary more than competing. Use Claude Projects for the depth of one workspace, and use a portable context file for the facts about you that should follow you everywhere. Creed is that context file: it connects to your agents over MCP, including Claude, so the same profile is read before every answer.",

      text: "Claude's project features are strong at scoping. A Project lets you attach documents, set custom instructions, and build up project knowledge that every conversation in that Project can draw on. For sustained work on one thing, a client, a codebase, a research area, that depth is exactly right. Claude also keeps context within a workspace so you are not re-uploading the same files each session.",

    {
      type: "p",
      text: "This is genuinely useful, and a portable context file does not replace it. If you need Claude to reason over a large body of specific material for one initiative, Projects are the better container for that material. Keeping a fifty-page spec in your personal profile would be the wrong move; keeping it in a Project is the right one.",

      text: "The boundary is the same one every built-in feature has: it lives inside Claude. Project knowledge and Claude's memory do not travel to ChatGPT or Cursor, so context you build in Claude does not make your other tools any smarter. Scoping is also per-workspace by design, which means the durable facts about you get repeated across Projects rather than kept in one place. And what Claude retains as memory is shaped by the app, not laid out as a document you edit line by line.",
